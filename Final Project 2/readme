Learn the definition of data structures, which helps the developer organize data so it can be used efficiently and easy to read or remember overtime. These collections consist primitive data types, such as arrays, classes, lists, strings, and much more. 
Using a LinkedList has a better advantage when it comes to adding elements in the middle of the collection versus an ArrayList, so it’s better to have an ArrayList for permanent elements, but it is commonly used for data structure. Many developers believed that using vectors is bad practice because it synchronizes operators one at a time, which makes it slower. 
It is best to practice and note the advantage and disadvantage when structuring data. Study the Collection diagram gave me a better understanding of how array and linked structures are implemented and how other structures differ from other data types. 
Most frequently used package for data structures is Oracle’s java.util using the collections framework. I find better descriptions when I search through Oracle’s API documents because it’s organized through a list of classes, finding the constructor and method examples. 
Stack data structure is described by LIFO and Queue is FIFO. These acronyms help me memorize how these data structures operate differently. Both data structures have common methods when adding and removing an item to and from the list.
